**Description:**
This course has been designed by a Data Scientist and a Machine Learning expert so that we can share our knowledge and help you learn complex theory,
algorithms, and coding libraries in a simple way.This course can be completed by either doing either the Python tutorials, or R tutorials, or both - Python & R. Pick the programming language that you need for your career.

This course is fun and exciting, and at the same time, we dive deep into Machine Learning. It is structured the following way:

Part 1 - Data Preprocessing

Part 2 - Regression: Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, SVR, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression

Part 3 - Classification: Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification

Part 4 - Clustering: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering

Part 5 - Association Rule Learning: Apriori, Eclat

Part 6 - Reinforcement Learning: Upper Confidence Bound, Thompson Sampling

Part 7 - Natural Language Processing: Bag-of-words model and algorithms for NLP

Part 8 - Deep Learning: Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks

Part 9 - Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, LDA, Kernel PCA

Part 10 - Model Selection & Boosting: k-fold Cross Validation, Parameter Tuning, Grid Search, XGBoost

Each section inside each part is independent. So you can either take the whole course from start to finish or you can jump right into any specific section and learn what you need for your career right now.

Moreover, the course is packed with practical exercises that are based on real-life case studies. So not only will you learn the theory, but you will also get lots of hands-on practice building your own models.

And as a bonus, this course includes both Python and R code templates which you can download and use on your own projects.
